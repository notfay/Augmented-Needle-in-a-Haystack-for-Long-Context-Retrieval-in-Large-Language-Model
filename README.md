## AI-Generated Content Disclosure

Use of Generative AI: The Python source code in this repository, including the scripts used for experiments was generated or assisted by large language models, specifically Google Gemini and Anthropic Claude. These tools were utilized to facilitate code structure, optimization, and script automation. Additionally, AI tools were used to refine the grammar and linguistic clarity of the documentation and associated manuscript; however, all narrative content, technical descriptions, and arguments were authored purely by humans.

Integrity of Results: The authors declare that the use of generative AI was strictly limited to software development and grammatical refinement. All experimental results, figures, tables, and data outputs presented in the associated research were produced through the manual and automated execution of these scripts on original datasets. No part of the scientific findings, statistical interpretations, or results was generated by AI. The authors have reviewed all AI-assisted content and take full responsibility for its technical accuracy and the integrity of the work.
