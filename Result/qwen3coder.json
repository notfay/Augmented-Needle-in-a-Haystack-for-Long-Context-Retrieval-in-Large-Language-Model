Even if the anchor is arbitrary or irrelevant, it significantly influences later perceptions and decisions (e.g., initial price offers in negotiations, first impressions of a house).\n2.  **Adjustment Heuristic:** Related to anchoring, people often start with the initial information and make insufficient adjustments when forming subsequent judgments. The first detail provides a starting point that biases the final assessment.\n3.  **Selective Attention and Focus (Focalism):** The first detail encountered can become the focus of attention. This focus leads people to concentrate on that aspect while potentially neglecting other relevant information, making the initial detail disproportionately influential in later evaluations.\n4.  **Availability:** The first-seen detail is often more mentally accessible or \"available\" when making later judgments. Because it's easier to recall, it gets weighted more heavily in the evaluation process.\n5.  **Expectation and Sense-Making:** The initial detail can shape expectations about what will come next or how a situation should be interpreted.

        "response": "Based on the provided text, a favorable self-judgment, particularly through the self-serving bias, can lead to less deep or less rigorous cognitive processing in certain situations. Here's how the text supports this:\n\n1.  **Reduced Effortful Processing:** The text states that people high in the self-serving bias \"showed less confidence in their personal beliefs\" and were \"more likely to attribute failure internally when they perceive a high probability of improvement.\" However, when they perceive a *low* probability of improvement, they engage in \"self-serving bias, attributing failure externally.\" This latter case involves less effortful processing (attributing failure to external factors) compared to deeply analyzing their own potential shortcomings.\n2.  **Avoidance of Negative Information:** The self-serving bias can involve \"ignoring contradictory information\" or \"focusing on information that supports one's beliefs\" (confirmation bias section). This selective attention avoids the cognitive effort needed to deeply process challenging or negative feedback.\n3.  **Maintaining Positive Self-Image:** The motivation to maintain a positive self-view (linked to self-enhancement and self-presentation motives for the self-serving bias) can lead individuals to \"ignore or forget more distant information\" (availability heuristic) or engage in \"selective perception\" (fundamental attribution error section), filtering information through a lens that confirms their positive self-judgment, rather than processing all information equally.\n4.  **Relying on Heuristics:** While not explicitly stated for self-serving bias, the text notes that biases like the *confirmation bias* (closely related) lead people to use \"heuristics\" (mental shortcuts) rather than engaging in more effortful, systematic analysis (\"central route\" processing as implied by elaboration likelihood model mentioned under confirmation bias).\n\nIn summary, the provided text suggests that a favorable self-judgment, facilitated by the self-serving bias, often leads individuals to engage in less effortful, less thorough cognitive processing by selectively attending to positive information, ignoring contradictory evidence, and potentially relying more on mental shortcuts to maintain their self-image.",

        "response": "Based on the provided text, the concept of what is seen first influencing subsequent judgments and decisions is captured by several related phenomena:\n\n1.  **Primacy Effect:** This is explicitly defined as the tendency for items near the beginning of a sequence to be remembered better and influence judgments more strongly (\"Items near the end of a sequence are the easiest to recall, followed by the items at the beginning\"). In perception and judgment, the first information tends to carry more weight.\n2.  **Anchoring Bias:** This is a prime example. The initial piece of information encountered (\"the anchor\") heavily influences subsequent numerical estimates or judgments, even when that anchor is irrelevant or arbitrary. The text notes this effect in various contexts, including decision-making, pricing, and negotiations. Adjustments from this initial anchor are often insufficient.\n3.  **Framing Effect:** The way information is initially presented (framed) significantly influences decisions. For instance, describing meat as \"75% lean\" versus \"25% fat\" leads to different perceptions and choices, even though the information is logically equivalent. The initial *frame* shifts the perspective.\n4.  **Priming:** While not a bias itself, priming explains the mechanism behind many biases. Exposure to an initial stimulus (like a word, image, or concept) influences responses to subsequent, related stimuli. The first thing seen can activate associated ideas, making them more accessible and likely to influence later judgments (e.g., the \"hilot\" example).\n5.  **Availability Cascade/Heuristic:** Information or an idea encountered first can become more prominent and readily recalled, influencing subsequent judgments about frequency or probability. If an initial vivid example comes to mind easily, it might be judged as more likely.\n6.  **Confirmation Bias:** Initial beliefs or hypotheses, potentially formed from early information, lead people to selectively search for, interpret, and recall information that confirms those pre-existing views, creating a downstream shift towards reinforcing the initial impression.\n7.  **Perceptual Set:** Although not a named entry, the text implies this through examples like the \"rat-man\" ambiguous image. What is seen first (or what one expects to see based on context) can determine how an ambiguous stimulus is perceived.\n\nIn summary, the text suggests that what is seen or encountered first translates into a measurable downstream shift by acting as an anchor, a frame, a prime, or by initiating a cascade of availability or confirmation, thereby influencing memory, interpretation, and subsequent decisions.",

        "response": "Based on the provided text, a first-seen detail can become a reference point in later evaluation through several interconnected cognitive processes:\n\n1.  **Anchoring:** The initial piece of information (the \"anchor\") heavily influences subsequent judgments. People tend to rely too heavily on this first piece of information when making decisions (e.g., estimating values, assessing likelihood). Adjustments made from this anchor are often insufficient, meaning the initial anchor continues to bias the final assessment (Anchoring Bias, Hiatus heuristic).\n2.  **Availability Cascade & Salience:** When a detail is encountered, especially if it's vivid or emotionally charged, it becomes more readily available in memory. This availability can make the detail seem more important or frequent (Availability Heuristic). If this detail is then repeatedly recalled or discussed, it can initiate an \"availability cascade,\" making it even more prominent and likely to be used as a reference point.\n3.  **Selective Attention and Encoding:** Attention is drawn to novel or prominent stimuli. The first encounter with a detail often captures attention, leading to its encoding into memory. This initial encoding can be particularly strong if the detail is associated with effort, surprise, or emotional significance (Salience, Hiatus heuristic, Ease of Retrieval).\n4.  **Formation of Prototypes/Expectations:** Early experiences or information can contribute to forming mental models, prototypes, or expectations for a category or situation. Subsequent encounters are often compared against this initial reference point or expectation (Representativeness Heuristic, Expectation-Based Learning).\n5.  **Memory and Reconstruction:** When evaluating something later, people often recall the initial detail. Memories are not perfect replays; they are reconstructed. The first-seen detail, being part of the initial encoding, can disproportionately influence this reconstructed memory and thus the later evaluation (Memory Bias, Choice-Supportive Bias).\n6.  **Priming:** Exposure to the initial detail can subconsciously influence how subsequent related information is processed and evaluated, making perceptions and judgments consistent with the initial stimulus (Implicit Association).\n\nIn essence, the first-seen detail grabs attention, gets encoded into memory, potentially sets an anchor or expectation, and becomes a readily available reference point against which later information is compared and evaluated, often without full awareness of its influence.",

Studies by Chaiken & Trope (1999) and others, cited in the document, show that when outcomes are positive or success is expected, individuals engage in more **careful, effortful processing** (central/systematic processing) of information.\n2.  **Motivation for Accuracy:** Theories like the self-validation model (Chaiken & Trope, 1999) suggest that when people expect to perform well or have a positive self-view regarding the task, they are more motivated to process information carefully to confirm their positive expectations or self-image. This motivation leads to deeper processing.\n3.  **Contrast with Negative Outcomes:** Conversely, when outcomes are negative or failure is anticipated, the text notes a tendency towards less effortful processing (peripheral/heuristic processing) or even biased processing to protect the self-concept, although the *depth* of processing itself isn't explicitly described as shallower in this context, the *effort* and *type* (heuristic vs. systematic) differs.\n\nTherefore, the document implies that a favorable self-judgment or the expectation of success linked to a positive self-view motivates individuals to engage in deeper, more careful cognitive processing of the task at hand.",

People tend to adjust their subsequent estimates or decisions from this initial anchor, often insufficiently (Anchoring and adjustment section, Baseline subsection, Association subsection, Inertia subsection; also mentioned under Dual process theory and Behavioral economics).\n3.  **Framing Effect:** The way information is initially presented (framed) significantly influences decisions. For example, describing an option as a gain versus a loss, or emphasizing survival rates versus mortality rates, can lead to measurably different choices, even when the underlying facts are equivalent (Framing effect section; also under Prospect theory, Dual process theory, and Behavioral economics).\n4.  **Priming:** While not explicitly named as a bias in the list, the concept is implicit. The initial stimulus (like the \"anchor\" or the first frame) acts as a prime, making related thoughts more accessible and thus influencing later judgments (Anchoring and adjustment section, Association subsection; Fluency heuristic section).\n\nThese initial perceptions create a measurable shift downstream by setting a reference point (anchor/prime/frame) that biases how subsequent information is processed, evaluated, and ultimately used in decision-making, often leading to systematic deviations from rational judgment.",

The final judgment remains biased towards the anchor.\n3.  **Selective Attention and Focus:** The first-seen detail can become the focus of attention. This is related to *focalism*, where the individual concentrates on this initial piece of information, potentially ignoring other relevant factors. This focused attention reinforces its influence.\n4.  **Assimilation to Ideal Concepts:** Initial information can be quickly categorized or associated with existing mental models or ideals. This association can make the initial detail seem more representative or significant, shaping how subsequent information is interpreted in relation to this now \"typical\" or \"expected\" reference point.\n5.  **Memory Encoding:** The way information is initially processed and stored in memory can be influenced by what is encountered first. This early information can set a template or baseline for how similar information is perceived and evaluated later.\n6.  **Priming:** Exposure to the first detail can activate related concepts in memory, making them more accessible. This influences the interpretation of subsequent information, often in a way consistent with the initial detail.\n7.  **Establishing a Standard:** The first detail can act as a benchmark or norm against which later information is compared.

It lists methods like \"training,\" \"incentives,\" and \"nudges.\"\n3.  **Learning from Experience (Implicit):** While not explicitly stating \"keeping a log,\" the concept of learning from past mistakes is inherent in debiasing. Recognizing patterns in one's own or others' past faulty decisions (the \"faults\") is a key step in identifying where biases occurred.\n4.  **Training and Awareness:** By reviewing past instances where biases led to errors (effectively, a log of prior faults), individuals can become more aware of their tendencies and the situations where they are prone to specific biases. This awareness is a crucial component of many debiasing training efforts.\n5.  **Improved Decision-Making:** The ultimate goal of identifying and learning from these past faults, through debiasing, is to reduce the likelihood of repeating the same errors, thereby improving the quality of future judgment and decision-making.\n\nTherefore, the provided text suggests that keeping a log of prior faults contributes to future work by serving as a tool for learning and awareness, which are essential elements of debiasing strategies aimed at improving future performance.",

        "response": "Based on the provided text, a favorable self-judgment, particularly when it involves positive outcomes or success, can lead to **shallower** cognitive processing.\n\nHere's the reasoning from the text:\n\n1.  **Egocentric Bias and Processing Depth:** The text discusses egocentric bias, where individuals rely heavily on their own perspective. It mentions the **self-reference effect**, where information is better recalled if it relates to the self. While this relates to *what* is processed (self-relevant information), it doesn't directly address the *depth* in terms of effort for unrelated tasks.\n2.  **Mood and Processing:** The text states, \"Positive moods... result in an increase in people's risk estimates about the prevalence of crime and violence in the real world.\" While this relates to judgment, it doesn't directly link positive self-judgment to processing depth.\n3.  **Overconfidence and Effort Reduction:** The text explains the **overconfidence effect**, where individuals overestimate their abilities or the accuracy of their judgments. Crucially, it mentions that this overconfidence can lead to **reduced effort**: \"Overconfidence can lead pilots to operate a new aircraft for which they lack adequate training or to engage in flight maneuvers that exceed their proficiency.\" This implies that a positive self-assessment (overconfidence) can lead to putting in *less* effort or engaging in *shallower* processing/approach than warranted.\n4.  **Self-Serving Bias and Effort:** The text notes that the self-serving bias can lead people to \"take more credit for successes.\" While not explicitly stated for self-serving bias, the link between positive self-judgment (success) and reduced effort is reinforced.\n5.  **Positive Mood and Shallow Processing:** The text states, \"individuals under positive moods... engage in more effortful processing\" seems contradictory at first, but it's important to note the context. However, regarding the *direct link between favorable self-judgment and task processing*, the key point linking it to *reduced* depth/effort is the **overconfidence effect** leading to behaviors like \"relying on heuristics,\" acting \"without deliberate analysis,\" and engaging in \"simpler strategies\" (as mentioned under the \"Effort justification\" section, although that specific section deals with effort put into achieving an outcome affecting its valuation, the principle of reduced perceived need for effort due to positive self-assessment like overconfidence is relevant).\n\nTherefore, the provided text suggests that a favorable self-judgment, particularly when it manifests as overconfidence, can lead individuals to engage in shallower cognitive processing by reducing the perceived need for effort or leading them to rely on simpler, less effortful strategies.",

        "response": "Based on the provided text, the concept of what is seen first influencing subsequent judgments and decisions is captured by several related phenomena:\n\n1.  **Primacy Effect:** This is explicitly defined as remembering items at the beginning of a list better (a form of serial position effect). While the text notes this effect, it doesn't detail the specific downstream *measurement* of a shift caused by the first item seen.\n2.  **Anchoring Bias:** This is a key mechanism. The text explains that individuals rely too heavily on the first piece of information encountered (the \"anchor\") when making decisions. This initial information serves as a reference point.\n    *   **Measurement of Shift:** The text describes how anchoring influences judgments:\n        *   In estimation tasks, the anchor skews the final estimate towards the initial value (e.g., estimating the percentage of African countries in the UN after seeing a random number).\n        *   In negotiation, the first offer often acts as an anchor, influencing the final negotiated outcome (\"pulling\" it towards the initial offer).\n        *   The text notes that adjustments away from the anchor are often insufficient, leading to a biased final judgment that reflects the influence of the initial, first-seen anchor.\n3.  **Framing Effect:** The way information is presented first (the \"frame\") significantly influences decisions. The text states this effect is \"powerful\" and influences choices across domains. The shift is measured by the different choices people make when presented with the *same* information but framed differently (e.g., as gains vs. losses).\n4.  **Availability Cascade & Salience:** Information encountered first can become more available and salient.\n    *   The \"availability cascade\" describes how initial information, through repetition, becomes more believable and influential, leading others to adopt it.\n    *   Salience bias means we focus on prominent initial information. This can lead to ignoring subsequent, less striking information, creating a downstream shift in focus and potentially judgment.\n5.  **Perceptual Set & Selective Attention:** Although not named as such in the summary, the text touches on how initial exposure or instructions influence what is noticed later (e.g., in visual perception tasks or when interpreting ambiguous stimuli). The first exposure sets a \"set\" or expectation, directing attention to subsequent information that fits that initial view, potentially biasing interpretation.\n6.  **Priming (Implicit):** While not explicitly named \"priming,\" the text describes related concepts:\n    *   Initial exposure to a stimulus (like a briefly flashed image or word) can influence later judgments or behaviors, even if not consciously remembered (e.g., the subliminal smile/polygon study influencing liking).\n    *   The \"illusory truth effect\" shows that statements heard first (and thus more easily processed) are more likely to be judged as true later.\n\nIn summary, the text indicates that what is seen first translates into a measurable downstream shift primarily through **anchoring** (biasing numerical estimates and decisions towards the initial value), **framing** (altering choices based on the initial presentation format), initiating **availability cascades** (increasing belief and influence of the initial information), and directing **attention/salience** (focusing subsequent processing on information matching the initial input). These shifts are measured by observing the difference in final judgments, choices, or recalled information compared to scenarios where different information was presented first.",

However, the text notes that these adjustments are often insufficient, meaning the final judgment remains biased towards the original anchor.\n3.  **Example:** The text provides an example where participants were asked to estimate the percentage of African countries in the UN. The initial spin of a (random) roulette wheel, which stopped on either 10 or 65, acted as an anchor. Participants' subsequent estimates were significantly influenced by this irrelevant initial number, with those seeing 10 giving lower estimates than those seeing 65.\n\nTherefore, the mechanism described is that the *first* piece of information (the anchor) regarding a specific judgment heavily influences the initial reference point for that judgment, and subsequent information processing and adjustments tend to be made in relation to this first-seen detail, often insufficiently.",

Keeping a record of past errors can make one more aware of their own susceptibility to biases.\n2.  **Counters Hindsight Bias:** The text discusses \"hindsight bias,\" the tendency to see past events as more predictable than they were. A log helps maintain an accurate record of the past state of knowledge and decisions, preventing the distortion of memory.\n3.  **Addresses Planning Fallacy & Overconfidence:** The \"planning fallacy\" (underestimating task time/difficulty) and \"overconfidence effect\" involve unrealistic optimism. Reviewing past faults, especially those stemming from poor planning or overestimation of abilities, can serve as a corrective measure against these tendencies.\n4.  **General Debiasing Strategy:** The text notes that methods like \"considering alternative explanations\" or \"looking for evidence that might disprove a favored idea\" can reduce specific biases. A fault log essentially provides concrete evidence of past failures, forcing a confrontation with reality and acting as a debiasing tool.\n5.  **Improves Calibration:** By reviewing past predictions or judgments (especially faulty ones) against actual outcomes, individuals can better calibrate their future estimates and confidence levels, reducing errors like the overconfidence effect or impact bias.\n\nIn essence, the document suggests that recording prior faults helps counteract various cognitive biases by providing a factual reference point, increasing self-awareness of one's fallibility, and offering concrete examples of past errors to inform and improve future decisions.",

The initial, favorable assessment feels sufficient (Motivation section under Self-serving bias, discussing self-enhancement).\n\nTherefore, arriving at a favorable self-judgment tends to decrease the depth of subsequent cognitive processing related to that judgment, as the primary goal (maintaining self-esteem) is achieved, reducing the drive for critical analysis.",

        "response": "Based on the provided text, the concept of what is seen first influencing subsequent judgments and decisions is captured by several related phenomena:\n\n1.  **Primacy Effect:** This is a memory bias where items presented first in a sequence are better recalled. The text notes this relates to how initial information is processed (\"List-length effect: A smaller percentage of items are remembered in a longer list, but as the absolute number of items remembered increases, the relative number of first items remembered increases as well.\").\n2.  **Anchoring Bias:** Individuals rely too heavily on the first piece of information encountered (the \"anchor\") when making decisions. The text explains: \"the anchoring bias, or focalism, is the tendency to rely too heavily\u2014to 'anchor'\u2014on one trait or piece of information when making decisions (usually the first piece of information acquired on that subject).\" This initial anchor then influences subsequent judgments, even when adjustments are made.\n3.  **Framing Effect:** The way information is initially presented (\"framed\") significantly impacts decisions. \"Framing effects have powerful real-world influences... subtle shifts in wording\u2014such as presenting outcomes as gains or losses\u2014can reverse preferences.\" The initial frame sets the context for how subsequent information is interpreted.\n4.  **Priming:** Though not explicitly named as such in the summary, the concept is implied in discussions like the \"illusory truth effect\" (\"people are more likely to identify as true statements they have previously heard\") and the \"rhyme as reason effect\" (\"rhyming statements are perceived as more truthful\"). Initial exposure (seeing or hearing something first) makes related concepts more accessible, influencing later judgments.\n5.  **Order of Presentation in Decision Making:** Studies mentioned show that the order in which options are presented affects choice. For example, in the *Decoy Effect*, the presence of a third, inferior option changes the preference between the original two, depending on how it's presented relative to them. The first option(s) seen establish a comparison baseline.\n6.  **Perceptual Set and Interpretation:** Initial information or context influences how ambiguous stimuli are perceived. While not detailed in the summary, the mention of \"selective perception\" (\"the tendency for expectations to affect perception\") relates to this. What is seen or understood first shapes the lens through which subsequent information is filtered.\n\nIn essence, seeing something first establishes an initial reference point (anchor, frame, prime, or perceptual set) that measurably skews how subsequent information is processed, evaluated, and ultimately acted upon, leading to potentially different outcomes than if the information were presented in a different order.",

Even when people know the anchor might be irrelevant, they often adjust their estimates or decisions *starting from* this initial value. The text notes that adjustments made from this anchor are often \"insufficient,\" meaning the initial anchor continues to exert a strong pull on the final judgment.\n3.  **Example:** The text provides an example where participants were asked to estimate the percentage of African countries in the UN. Before estimating, they saw a (random) number from a rigged wheel of fortune (either 10 or 65). This random number served as an anchor. Participants who saw \"10\" gave lower estimates (average 25%) than those who saw \"65\" (average 45%). This shows how the first-seen, albeit arbitrary, number became the reference point influencing their later estimate.\n4.  **Persistence:** Anchoring is described as a robust phenomenon that is difficult to avoid, even when people are aware it's happening or when the anchor is clearly irrelevant. It can occur with both numerical values and non-numerical concepts (like the initial description of a person or situation).\n\nTherefore, the mechanism described is that an initial detail, simply by being encountered first, sets a mental reference point (the anchor) which then biases subsequent evaluations and adjustments, even if that detail is not necessarily relevant or accurate.",

This record serves as a deliberate counterbalance to the negativity bias's influence on memory and attention.\n4.  **Overcoming Bias Effects:** The text states, \"Studies of the negativity bias have also been related to research within the domain of decision-making... Learning and memory are direct consequences of attentional processing... Research points to a correlation between political affiliation and negativity bias...\" While it doesn't explicitly state \"keeping logs reduces bias,\" it implies that focusing on and recording negative instances (faults) can harness the bias's heightened attention and processing, turning it into a learning tool.\n5.  **Preventing Repeat Errors:** Although not explicitly stated for *logs*, the section on the *clustering illusion* mentions that \"survival of the fittest\" implies learning from past failures to adapt. Implicitly, a log facilitates this learning by making past failures more accessible and less subject to the distortions or fading that memory alone might undergo due to biases.\n\nTherefore, the provided text suggests that logging prior faults leverages the heightened cognitive impact of negative information (negativity bias) to ensure these events are thoroughly processed, remembered, and utilized for learning, thereby aiding in preventing similar mistakes in the future.",

This effortless processing is associated with the experiential system, which can be linked to maintaining a positive self-view.\n3.  **Avoiding rigorous analysis:** In the context of the self-reference effect (linking information to the self for better memory, often seen as favorable), it's noted that information is better encoded when produced actively (like generating one's own examples) rather than passively.

        "response": "Based on the provided text, the concept of what is seen first influencing subsequent judgments and decisions is captured by several related phenomena:\n\n1.  **Primacy Effect:** This is explicitly defined as the tendency for items near the beginning of a sequence to be better remembered. While defined in memory recall, the text links it to judgment: \"In social media, confirmation bias is amplified by the use of filter bubbles and \"algorithmic editing\", which display to individuals only information they are likely to agree with, while excluding opposing views. Some have argued that confirmation bias is the reason why society can never escape from filter bubbles, because individuals are psychologically hardwired to seek information that agrees with their preexisting values and beliefs.\" This suggests the initial information (seen first) shapes the filter bubble, influencing what is encountered and believed downstream.\n2.  **Anchoring Effect:** The text describes this as the tendency for an individual's judgments or decisions to be influenced by a reference point or \"anchor,\" often the first piece of information encountered. Examples illustrate the downstream shift:\n    *   Participants who saw a random number sequence starting high (8x7x6...) estimated a significantly higher product than those who saw a low-starting sequence (1x2x3...), even though both sequences multiplied to the same value.\n    *   Real estate agents, presented with different listing prices for the *same* house, were influenced by that initial price (the anchor) in their appraisal of its value and their negotiation strategies. A higher initial price led to higher final estimates and affected the perceived negotiation range.\n    *   In sentencing, the initial information or framing (e.g., a prosecutor's request) can act as an anchor, pulling the final sentence towards that initial point.\n    *   The text notes anchoring is \"pervasive across diverse judgment scenarios.\"\n3.  **Framing Effect:** How information is initially presented (framed) significantly influences decisions. The classic example is describing meat as \"75% lean\" versus \"25% fat\" \u2013 the initial positive frame (\"lean\") leads to a more favorable downstream perception and choice compared to the initial negative frame (\"fat\").\n4.  **Availability Cascade/Heuristic:** Information that is encountered first (or more frequently/memorably) becomes more mentally available. This initial availability biases downstream judgments about the frequency or likelihood of similar events. The \"availability cascade\" specifically describes how an initial idea, once circulating, gains momentum and becomes more readily accepted as true, influencing subsequent beliefs and discussions.\n5.  **Priming:** Although not a major focus, the text mentions the \"rhyme as reason effect,\" where information encountered first (a rhyming statement) is perceived as more truthful downstream.\n\nIn summary, the text indicates that what is seen or encountered first acts as a powerful reference point (anchor), frame, or readily available example, measurably biasing subsequent judgments, estimations, decisions, and perceptions in a predictable direction.",

Adjustments are made from this initial point, but these adjustments are often insufficient, leading to a bias towards the initial anchor (Tversky & Kahneman's anchoring effect).\n2.  **Availability Heuristic:** Information that is readily available in memory (like the first-seen detail, which is often prominent or recent) is used as a basis for judging the frequency, likelihood, or other characteristics of similar information later. It becomes the most accessible reference.\n3.  **Selective Attention and Confirmation Bias (Frequency Illusion Context):** Once a detail is noticed for the first time, selective attention focuses on it more frequently afterward. Confirmation bias then leads individuals to look for and interpret subsequent information in a way that confirms the perceived increased frequency or relevance of that initial detail, reinforcing its role as a reference point.\n4.  **Priming:** The first-seen detail can act as a prime, influencing the interpretation of later, related information. It activates associated concepts in memory, making them more accessible and likely to be used as a reference.\n5.  **Salience:** If the first-seen detail is particularly striking or unusual, it becomes highly salient. Salient features tend to dominate later judgments and evaluations, serving as the primary reference point.\n6.  **Memory Encoding and Recall:** Initial information can be encoded more deeply or become more accessible in memory. When evaluating later information, this easily recalled first detail serves as the comparator or reference.\n7.  **Establishing a Norm or Standard:** The first instance of something can set a standard or norm against which future instances are compared (e.g., the first price seen for a product, the initial performance level in a task).\n\nIn essence, the first-seen detail grabs attention, gets encoded into memory, and subsequently acts as a benchmark or anchor against which later information is processed, evaluated, and compared.",

This can inform better approaches for the current, potentially related issue.\n3.  **Identifying Root Causes:** Looking at old, similar bugs can help pinpoint underlying causes or patterns that might be relevant to the new problem, potentially leading to a more robust fix.\n4.  **Avoiding Previously Tried (and Failed) Solutions:** Developers can see what approaches were taken before and whether they were successful or not, saving time and preventing the repetition of ineffective fixes.\n5.  **Facilitating Knowledge Transfer:** Bug histories serve as a repository of knowledge, helping new team members or those unfamiliar with a codebase quickly get up to speed on known issues and their resolutions.\n6.  **Improving Debugging Efficiency:** Having a record of related past issues provides a reference point, potentially speeding up the diagnosis and resolution process for new, similar problems.",

Here's how the document supports this:\n\n1.  **Mitigates Hindsight Bias:** The text defines hindsight bias as the tendency to see past events as having been predictable. Keeping a log helps counteract this because you have a record of your actual predictions and judgments *before* the outcome was known, preventing the distortion of past beliefs.\n2.  **Facilitates Learning from Experience:** By documenting past errors, you create a concrete reference point. This helps overcome biases like belief perseverance (holding onto beliefs despite contradictory evidence) and the general difficulty of learning from mistakes. It forces a more objective review of what went wrong.\n3.  **Improves Calibration and Reduces Overconfidence:** Reviewing a log of past predictions and their outcomes (especially failures) can highlight instances where confidence exceeded accuracy (overconfidence effect). This helps individuals become better calibrated in their future judgments.\n4.  **Provides Data for Better Decision-Making:** The text mentions using logs or records (like in experiments tracking decisions and outcomes) to understand and potentially correct for biases. A log provides empirical data on past performance, which can inform and improve future strategies, rather than relying on potentially flawed memory or biased recollection.\n\nIn essence, a log of prior faults serves as an objective record that helps counteract the inherent biases in human memory and judgment, leading to more accurate assessments and better decisions in the future.",

The text defines it as the tendency to rely too heavily on the *first* piece of information acquired (the \"anchor\") when making decisions. This initial information disproportionately influences later judgments, even when it's irrelevant. Studies show the anchor affects subsequent information processing and final estimates or decisions.\n3.  **Framing Effect:** How information is presented initially (framed) significantly impacts decisions. The text notes that people tend to draw different conclusions from the same information depending on how it's presented first.\n4.  **Availability Cascade/Heuristic:** Information or ideas that come to mind first (often because they were encountered first or recently) are perceived as more important or likely. This initial availability can shape the perception of subsequent information.\n5.  **Order of Presentation in Decision Making:** The text mentions that in impression formation, the order in which traits are presented can influence the overall impression, highlighting the impact of initial information.\n6.  **Priming:** While not named as such in the summary, the concept is implied.

The text notes, \"...individuals make judgments by making adjustments from an initial anchor point...\"\n3.  **Insufficient Adjustment:** Crucially, the adjustment process is often inadequate. People adjust insufficiently from the initial anchor, meaning their final judgment remains biased towards that first piece of information. The text states, \"In effect, a cognitively difficult problem is dealt with by answering a rather simpler problem, without being aware of this happening. This theory explains cases where judgements fail to show regression toward the mean.\" and also describes how the anchor serves as a \"standard suggested amount of consumption\" or a baseline for comparison.\n4.  **Influence on Perception:** This anchoring reference point affects how subsequent information is perceived and evaluated.

By understanding what went wrong previously (the \"faults\"), individuals and organizations can better prepare for, respond to, and recover from similar future events.\n4.  **Preparedness:** The text mentions that normalcy bias causes inadequate preparation. Conversely, acknowledging and recording past faults helps in proper preparation, which is part of the \"preparation\" stage mentioned as a way to counter the bias.\n\nTherefore, the text implies that documenting or keeping track of prior faults helps overcome the tendency to underestimate risks (normalcy bias), thereby improving future preparedness and response.",

        "response": "Based on the provided text, the concept of what is seen first influencing subsequent judgments or decisions is captured by several related phenomena:\n\n1.  **Primacy Effect:** This is explicitly defined as the tendency for items near the beginning of a sequence to be remembered better and influence judgments more strongly (\"Items near the end of a sequence are the easiest to recall, followed by the items at the beginning\"). It's also mentioned in the context of impression formation, where initial information carries more weight (\"people tend to place more attention on more recent information and either ignore or forget more distant information\"; contrasted with recency).\n2.  **Anchoring Bias:** This is a prime example. The initial piece of information (\"anchor\") heavily influences subsequent numerical estimates or decisions, even when that anchor is irrelevant (\"The anchoring bias, or focalism, is the tendency to rely too heavily\u2014to 'anchor'\u2014on one trait or piece of information when making decisions\"). The text notes this can lead to insufficient adjustment from that initial anchor.\n3.  **Framing Effect:** The way information is initially presented (framed) significantly influences decisions (\"Studies show that people tend to make different decisions depending on whether the same option is presented in terms of gains or losses\"). This initial framing sets the context for how subsequent information is processed.\n4.  **Confirmation Bias & Selective Exposure:** While not strictly about *time* order, the tendency to interpret new information in light of existing beliefs (which could be formed from early information) is relevant. People seek information that confirms their initial views (\"People display this bias when they select information that supports their views, ignoring contrary information\").\n5.  **Priming:** Mentioned in the context of the availability heuristic (\"availability is influenced by how recent the memories are or how unusual or emotionally charged they may be\") and illusory correlation (\"illusory correlation: Inaccurately seeing a relationship between two events related by coincidence\"). Initial exposure (priming) makes related concepts more accessible, influencing later judgments.\n6.  **Order of Presentation in Decision Tasks:** In the context of the decoy effect, the order in which options (including the decoy) are presented can influence preferences for the target options (\"The third choice is called a decoy which is designed to induce consumers to change their preferences. The decoy is usually considered as inferior.\").\n\nThese mechanisms show how the initial information or the way a situation is first encountered can measurably shift downstream judgments, estimations, choices, and memory recall.",

However, these adjustments are frequently insufficient, meaning the final judgment remains biased towards the original anchor.\n3.  **Example:** The text provides an example where participants were asked to estimate the percentage of African countries in the UN. Before estimating, they saw a rigged roulette wheel stop at either 10 or 65. Those who saw 10 gave lower estimates (average 25%) than those who saw 65 (average 45%). The initial, random number served as an anchor, influencing their subsequent estimation.\n\nTherefore, the mechanism described is that the first piece of information encountered (the anchor) serves as a starting point for further mental processing and comparison, thereby becoming the reference against which later information is evaluated, often insufficiently adjusting away from this initial point.",

This counters the tendency to be overly optimistic about how easily new tasks will be completed (planning fallacy) or overestimating one's ability to handle them (overconfidence).\n2.  **Providing Realistic Data for Estimation:** Historical data on bug resolution times, complexity, and root causes offers concrete information. This helps in making more accurate estimates for effort, time, and resources needed for new, similar tasks, countering biases like the planning fallacy or general optimism bias.\n3.  **Learning from Past Mistakes (Experience):** Explicitly reviewing old bugs allows teams to understand *how* and *why* failures occurred previously. This knowledge can directly inform strategies and preventative measures for new work, avoiding the repetition of past errors. This is linked to concepts like debiasing through experience and learning from history.\n4.  **Improving Risk Assessment:** Understanding the types of issues that arose before helps in identifying potential risks in new projects. This counters biases like the optimism bias (underestimating negative event likelihood) or the ostrich effect (ignoring potentially negative information).\n5.  **Calibrating Judgments:** Exposure to past failures and the effort required to resolve them can help calibrate future judgments and predictions, making them less susceptible to biases like the illusion of control or unrealistic optimism.\n6.  **Facilitating Structured Problem-Solving:** Looking at old bugs often involves analyzing root causes and solutions. This process reinforces structured thinking and can prevent reliance on faulty heuristics or biases when approaching new problems.\n\nIn essence, tracking old bugs provides a factual basis that can counteract various cognitive biases which often lead to poor planning, underestimating challenges, and repeating mistakes in new endeavors. It promotes learning and more realistic expectations.",

        "response": "Based on the provided text, a favorable self-judgment, particularly in the context of the self-serving bias, can lead to less deep or less rigorous cognitive processing. Here's why:\n\n1.  **Self-Serving Bias and Motivation:** The self-serving bias involves attributing successes to internal factors (like ability) and failures to external factors (like luck or task difficulty). This bias is driven by motivations like self-enhancement (maintaining self-worth) and self-presentation (managing others' impressions).\n2.  **Reduced Need for Deep Processing:** When individuals receive positive feedback or make successful judgments, the self-serving bias leads them to attribute this success internally (\"I did well because I'm capable\"). This positive self-attribution can fulfill the motivational goals (feeling good, appearing competent) *without* requiring them to engage deeply with the task details or potential shortcomings.\n3.  **Example from the Text:** The text mentions the \"Dunning-Kruger effect,\" where unskilled individuals overestimate their ability. This overestimation (a form of favorable self-judgment) means they *don't recognize their own lack of skill or the need for deeper processing*. They are \"unaware of their incompetence,\" which includes being \"unable to tell the difference between competence and incompetence.\" Their favorable self-view shields them from recognizing the depth of processing they *actually* need but aren't engaging in.\n4.  **Contrast with Negative Outcomes:** Conversely, when people face failure or negative feedback, the self-serving bias might lead them to blame external factors. While this protects the self, the very act of *attributing* the failure externally might sometimes involve less deep analysis of their own potential contribution to the failure, compared to a more objective analysis.\n\nIn essence, a favorable self-judgment, especially one that is inflated or not critically examined (as in the Dunning-Kruger effect), can reduce the perceived need to engage in deeper, more effortful, or more critical cognitive processing of the task or one's performance on it. The positive feeling or conclusion derived from the self-judgment itself acts as a stopping point, potentially bypassing more thorough analysis.",

        "response": "Based on the provided text, the concept of what is seen first influencing subsequent judgments and decisions is captured by several related cognitive biases and heuristics:\n\n1.  **Anchoring Bias:** This is the most directly relevant concept. The text defines it as the tendency to rely too heavily on the first piece of information encountered (the \"anchor\") when making decisions. This initial information acts as a reference point that subsequent judgments \"adjust\" from, often insufficiently. Studies show this anchor can significantly influence final estimates or decisions, even if the anchor is arbitrary or irrelevant. The text mentions this effect occurs in various contexts, including numerical estimates, pricing, and even legal judgments.\n2.  **Primacy Effect:** Mentioned specifically in the context of memory and impression formation, this effect describes how items presented first in a sequence are better recalled and tend to have a stronger influence on judgments (e.g., forming impressions of people).\n3.  **Availability Cascade/Heuristic:** While not strictly about \"seeing first,\" the availability heuristic explains that people judge the likelihood of events based on how easily examples come to mind. Information encountered first (or more recently, vividly) becomes more \"available,\" thus seeming more probable or influential in decision-making. An \"availability cascade\" describes how this initial, prominent information spreads and gains credence.\n4.  **Framing Effect:** The way information is initially *presented* (framed) significantly influences decisions. The text notes that people's choices can differ dramatically depending on whether the *first* piece of information they receive frames an option in terms of potential gains or potential losses, even if the outcomes are logically equivalent.\n5.  **Representativeness Heuristic:** When people assess the probability of an event, they often rely on how similar it is to a known prototype or category, especially if that comparison comes readily to mind based on initial information.\n\nIn summary, the document suggests that what is seen or encountered first translates into a measurable downstream shift primarily through **anchoring**, where the initial information serves as a powerful reference point, and through effects on **availability** and **framing**, which shape how subsequent information is processed and weighted in judgments. The **primacy effect** also plays a role in the order of information presentation.",

        "response": "Based on the provided text, a first-seen detail can become a reference point in later evaluation through several interconnected cognitive processes:\n\n1.  **Anchoring:** The initial piece of information (the first-seen detail) acts as an \"anchor.\" Subsequent judgments and estimates are made by adjusting away from this anchor. Even if the anchor is arbitrary or irrelevant, it significantly influences later perceptions and decisions (e.g., initial price offers in negotiations, first impressions in social interactions).\n2.  **Adjustment Heuristic:** While people are aware they need to adjust from the initial anchor, these adjustments are often insufficient. The final judgment remains biased towards the anchor. This is particularly evident when the anchor is the first piece of information encountered.\n3.  **Selective Attention and Focus:** The first detail can direct attention towards information that is consistent with it, due to mechanisms like selective perception or the focusing illusion. This makes information related to the initial detail more salient and influential in later evaluations.\n4.  **Priming:** Exposure to the first detail (even subliminally) can influence subsequent judgments. It activates related concepts in memory, making them more accessible and likely to be used in evaluating later information.\n5.  **Formation of Initial Impressions:** Especially in social contexts, the first piece of information about a person (like their appearance or initial behavior) can form a strong initial impression. This impression then acts as a filter, biasing the interpretation of subsequent information about that person (akin to the halo effect or first-impression bias).\n6.  **Establishing a Standard:** The first detail can set a standard or norm against which subsequent information is compared. This is related to how the \"contrast effect\" works, where the perception of something is altered due to comparison with a previously encountered stimulus.\n\nIn essence, the first-seen detail grabs cognitive priority, sets an initial reference point (the anchor), and then influences how subsequent information is perceived, attended to, and integrated, often leading to insufficient adjustment from that initial reference.",

        "response": "Based on the provided text, a favorable self-judgment, particularly through the self-serving bias, can lead to less deep or less rigorous cognitive processing in certain situations. Here's how the text supports this:\n\n1.  **Self-Serving Bias and Information Processing:** The text describes the self-serving bias as the tendency to attribute successes to internal factors (like ability) and failures to external factors (like luck or task difficulty). This bias can influence how information is processed.\n2.  **Protecting Self-Esteem:** The text explicitly states that the self-serving bias (a form of favorable self-judgment) can lead people to \"reject the validity of negative feedback\" and \"focus on their strengths and achievements but overlook their faults and failures.\" This selective focus inherently means *not* deeply processing negative or contradictory information, leading to a shallower, more defensive processing style.\n3.  **Motivated Reasoning:** The text mentions that self-enhancement (maintaining a positive self-view) is a motivation underlying the self-serving bias. Motivated reasoning often leads individuals to process information in a way that confirms their desired outcome (maintaining a positive self-image) rather than objectively evaluating all evidence deeply.\n4.  **Reduced Effort in Low Self-Esteem Context (Indirectly related):** While not directly about *favorable* self-judgment, the text notes that individuals with *lower* self-esteem (perhaps lacking favorable self-judgments) showed *less* bias (specifically the false consensus effect) and were described as potentially processing information more like \"rational processors,\" implying deeper processing. This suggests that lacking a strong positive self-view *might* sometimes lead to more effortful processing, contrasting with the potentially shielding effect of a strong positive self-view.\n5.  **Choice-Supportive Bias:** Although distinct, the related concept of choice-supportive bias (tending to remember chosen options more favorably) also demonstrates how positive self-regard regarding a decision can lead to biased memory processing, downplaying negatives and enhancing positives post-choice, rather than engaging in neutral, deep analysis.\n\nIn summary, the provided text suggests that a favorable self-judgment, particularly maintained through biases like the self-serving bias, often leads to *less* deep cognitive processing of information that threatens that positive self-view, favoring a more selective and defensive approach.",

        "response": "Based on the provided text, here's how seeing something first can translate into a measurable shift downstream, focusing on cognitive biases and heuristics:\n\n1.  **Anchoring Bias:** The initial piece of information encountered (the \"anchor\") heavily influences subsequent judgments and decisions, even if it's irrelevant. For example, in negotiations, the first price offered sets a reference point that pulls the final agreement towards that initial value (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974, Thaler, Sunstein). This shift is measurable in the final negotiated price being closer to the first offer than it might otherwise be.\n2.  **Framing Effects:** The way information is initially presented (framed) shapes how people perceive options and make choices. For instance, describing meat as \"75% lean\" versus \"25% fat\" leads to different consumer preferences (Tversky & Kahneman, 1981). This measurable shift occurs in the choice made or the value assigned to the product based on the initial framing.\n3.  **Availability Cascade/Heuristic:** An initial, vivid idea or piece of information that gains traction becomes more readily available in memory. This makes it easier to recall and thus seems more frequent or important, influencing subsequent judgments (Kahneman & Tversky, 1973; Kuran & Sunstein, 1998). The measurable shift is seen in increased public perception of the issue's importance or likelihood, or in decisions being made based on this easily recalled (but not necessarily representative) information.\n4.  **Priming:** Exposure to an initial stimulus (often subconsciously) influences responses to subsequent, related stimuli. While the text mentions the automaticity of processing (Kahneman), a direct measurable *decision* shift example isn't provided, but the underlying mechanism is described.\n5.  **Order Effects in Evaluation (Serial Position Effect, Recency/Illusion of Truth):** The order in which information is presented affects how it's judged. Items presented first (Primacy) or last (Recency) are often remembered better or judged differently. Additionally, repeated information or information presented first can seem more truthful (Illusory Truth Effect - Hasher et al., 1977 cited). This leads to a measurable shift in how subsequent information is evaluated or in the final judgment being influenced by the order of presentation.\n6.  **Confirmation Bias (related to initial exposure):** While confirmation bias involves seeking information that confirms *existing* beliefs, the first piece of information encountered on a topic can sometimes act as an initial belief or hypothesis. People might then selectively seek or interpret subsequent information to confirm this initial impression, leading to a measurable shift away from alternative viewpoints.\n\nIn essence, the initial perception acts as a reference point, frame, readily available example, or prime that measurably influences how subsequent information is processed, evaluated, and the ultimate decisions or judgments made.",

When people are given an initial value (like an asking price, a suggested donation amount, or even a random number), their later evaluations and decisions (such as estimating worth, making an offer, or deciding how much to contribute) tend to be adjusted *from* this anchor, often insufficiently. The text notes, \"Anchoring is the tendency to make future judgements or conclusions based too heavily on the original information supplied to them.\"\n3.  **Insufficient Adjustment:** The process often involves making adjustments *from* the anchor, but these adjustments are frequently inadequate, meaning the initial anchor continues to exert a strong pull on the final judgment. The text mentions this under the anchoring effect: \"...adjustment, on the other hand, is the process through which individuals make gradual changes to their initial judgements or conclusions.\"\n4.  **Example:** The text provides an example related to pricing: \"Consumers may... base their price perception by anchoring a high reference price...\" This initial high price becomes the reference point against which other prices or the perceived value of the item is judged.\n\nTherefore, the mechanism described is that an initial detail acts as an \"anchor,\" setting a reference point from which subsequent evaluations are made, often insufficiently adjusting away from this initial value.",

A log serves as a record of past faulty judgments or reasoning, allowing individuals to review these instances, understand the pitfalls, and adjust their future decision-making processes.\n4.  **Recognizing Patterns:** By recording faults, individuals can potentially identify recurring patterns in their errors or the types of situations where they make mistakes, allowing for more targeted corrective actions.\n5.  **Mitigating Specific Biases:** The text mentions techniques like \"considering alternative explanations\" or thinking about \"how one might be wrong\" to reduce biases. A log of past faults provides concrete examples to reflect on when employing such techniques, making them more effective.\n\nIn essence, the text suggests that people are prone to cognitive biases that lead to errors and often hinder learning from those errors. Keeping a log counters this by providing a concrete record for reflection, analysis, and the application of debiasing strategies, ultimately aiming to improve future performance by avoiding past mistakes.",

More general forms of erroneous pattern recognition are pareidolia and apophenia.\"). The *motivation* to use the self-serving bias is linked to managing self-image with less effort (\"These cognitive and perceptual tendencies perpetuate illusions and error, but they also serve the self's need for esteem,\" \"Self-enhancement aims to uphold self-worth\").\n3.  **Attribution and Effort:** One part of the text discussing self-serving bias mentions, \"Miller and Ross... argued that the self-serving bias people create is rational and not dependent on one's need for self-esteem. This means that if the outcome of an event is consistent with the person's expectation, then they will attribute dispositional (internal) factors. On the other hand, if the outcome of the event does not match the person's expectations, they will make situational attributions by blaming their surroundings instead of themselves.\" This implies a link between expectation (which could relate to perceived effort) and attribution type, but not directly to mental *demand* of the attribution process itself.\n\nWhile the text connects attributing outcomes to internal factors (like ability) with self-serving bias and potentially reducing the *emotional* or *motivational* effort needed to protect self-esteem, it doesn't explicitly state that this specific attribution style lowers the general *mental demand* (cognitive load) required for the judgment or decision-making process itself.",

This could be a price, a percentage, a specific data point, or even a random number.\n2.  **Influence on Subsequent Judgments:** When the person is then asked to make a judgment or estimate related to the same topic (e.g., the value of an item, the probability of an event, the appropriate sentence for a crime), the initial anchor significantly influences their thought process.\n3.  **Adjustment Process (Often Insufficient):** The classic explanation (Anchoring-and-Adjustment Heuristic) is that people start from the anchor value and adjust upwards or downwards to reach their final estimate. However, this adjustment is often insufficient. They don't adjust far enough away from the initial anchor.\n4.  **Measurable Shift:** This results in final judgments or decisions that are measurably closer to the initial anchor value than they would be otherwise. Studies consistently show that people presented with a high anchor tend to give higher subsequent estimates/judgments than those presented with a low anchor, even when the anchor is clearly irrelevant or even arbitrary.\n5.  **Quantifying the Effect:** This downstream shift is measurable because researchers can compare the average estimates or decisions of groups presented with different anchors. The consistent difference in these averages, attributable to the different initial anchors, demonstrates the measurable downstream shift caused by what was seen (or presented) first.\n\nIn essence, the initial anchor biases the reference point for subsequent thinking, leading to systematically different (and measurable) outcomes based on that first piece of information.",

This is seen in contexts like pricing (Hiatus heuristic, Default effect) and numerical estimations.\n2.  **Selective Attention and Confirmation Bias:** Once a detail grabs attention or fits a pre-existing belief (often the first strong or relevant detail noticed), attention tends to focus on information that confirms or relates to it. This detail becomes the reference point against which new information is judged, potentially leading to confirmation bias (Selective perception, Confirmation bias).\n3.  **Framing:** The way an option or situation is initially presented (framed) by the first detail encountered influences how it is perceived and evaluated subsequently. Different framings can lead to different choices even with identical outcomes (Framing effect).\n4.  **Priming:** Exposure to the first detail (stimulus) influences responses to subsequent stimuli. It activates associated concepts in memory, making them more accessible and likely to be used as a reference point in later judgments (Fluency heuristic, Availability heuristic implications).\n5.  **Establishing a Norm or Baseline:** The first detail can set a standard or baseline for comparison. Later options are evaluated relative to this initial standard (Normative influence, Base rate neglect if the initial detail is a specific case, not the base rate).\n6.  **Creating a Mental Model/Set:** The initial information can quickly form a mental representation or set. Subsequent processing and evaluation occur within the context of this initial model, using it as the reference (Representativeness heuristic, Halo effect, Fundamental attribution error).\n7.  **Perceptual Contrast:** Sometimes, the evaluation is explicitly relative, contrasting subsequent options against the initial one (Contrast effect).\n\nIn essence, the first detail encountered often sets the stage for how we process and evaluate everything that follows, acting as a benchmark or lens through which later information is filtered and judged.",

It is known that people prefer positive thoughts over negative ones in a number of ways: this is called the \"Pollyanna principle\". Applied to arguments or sources of evidence, this could explain why desired conclusions are more likely to be believed true. According to experiments that manipulate the desirability of the conclusion, people demand a high standard of evidence for unpalatable ideas and a low standard for preferred ideas. In other words, they ask, \"Can I believe this?\" for some suggestions and, \"Must I believe this?\" for others.\"\n\nThis suggests that when people attribute positive outcomes (like good results) to their own ability (a preferred internal attribution), they are applying a *lower* standard of evidence or scrutiny, which implies less cognitive effort or mental demand is placed on validating that particular explanation. They are more inclined to readily accept it (\"Can I believe this?\").\n\nTherefore, according to the text's description of the self-serving bias, attributing good results to ability does seem to lower the mental demand associated with evaluating that specific cause.",
